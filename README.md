# Builder

**Note:** This entire project has been generated by AI through an iterative process whereby it constantly improves itself in response to user direction via prompts.

## Overview

Builder is a Go program that facilitates an interactive coding experience powered by AI. It allows users to provide prompts and receive code responses generated by an AI model. The program is designed to assist in the development process by generating code based on user instructions.

## Features

- Interactive prompt-based coding experience
- AI-powered code generation based on user prompts
- Integration with the Anthropic API for AI model interaction
- Automatic creation of Git branches for version control
- Generation of README.md files describing the generated code
- Error handling and retry mechanisms for API requests
- Customizable file paths for code generation
- Support for loading configuration from a .env file

## Usage

1. Set up the necessary environment variables in a .env file, including the API_KEY for the Anthropic API.
2. Run the program using the command `go run main.go --file <file_path>`, where `<file_path>` is the path of the file to overwrite with the generated code.
3. Enter a prompt describing the desired code changes or additions.
4. The program will generate code based on the prompt and write it to the specified file.
5. The program will also generate a README.md file describing the purpose and functionality of the generated code.
6. Enter a branch name for version control purposes.
7. The program will create a new Git branch, commit the changes, and switch back to the original directory.

## Configuration

The program requires the following environment variables to be set in a .env file:

- `API_KEY`: The API key for the Anthropic API.

## Dependencies

The program relies on the following external dependencies:

- `github.com/joho/godotenv`: For loading environment variables from a .env file.

All other dependencies are part of the Go standard library.

## Limitations

- The program currently supports generating code only in the Go programming language.
- The generated code is limited to using the Go standard library and cannot import external packages.
- The AI model's response is limited to a maximum of 4028 tokens, so the generated code should be concise and fit within this limit.

## Contributing

As this project is generated by AI, contributions from humans are not expected. However, feedback and suggestions for improving the AI-generated code are welcome.
