# Builder

**Note: This entire project has been generated by AI, through an iterative process whereby it constantly improves itself in response to user direction via the prompt.**

## Overview

The Builder project is a Go program that automates the process of generating and updating code based on user prompts. It leverages the power of AI to generate code and README files, making it easier for developers to iterate on their projects.

## Features

- Generates code based on user prompts
- Overwrites specified files with the generated code
- Creates a new Git branch for each code generation iteration
- Generates a README.md file describing the purpose and functionality of the main code file
- Utilizes the Anthropic API for AI-powered code generation
- Handles API errors and retries failed requests
- Escapes and unescapes HTML entities in the generated code
- Trims unnecessary whitespace and backticks from the generated code

## Usage

1. Set the `API_KEY` environment variable in a `.env` file.
2. Run the program with the `--file` flag to specify the file path to overwrite with the generated code.
3. Enter a prompt describing the desired changes or additions to the code.
4. The program will generate new code based on the prompt and overwrite the specified file.
5. A new Git branch will be created with the generated code and README.md file.
6. The changes will be committed to the new branch.

## Configuration

- `API_KEY`: The API key for the Anthropic API, set in the `.env` file.
- `--file`: The file path to overwrite with the generated code (default: `./main.go`).

## Dependencies

- [github.com/joho/godotenv](https://github.com/joho/godotenv): Used for loading environment variables from the `.env` file.
